Description
===========

  These are the dot files for apps I use every day.
Among these apps are:
  
* bash: aliases, functions, completions
* vim: config and plugins
* vimperator: firefox plugin to make it vim-like, includes config and plugins
* irb: includes loader for loading irb snippets/libraries, includes a todo/ of snippets
  I've yet to look at
* tabtab: ruby gem for ruby-based completion
* lightning: my own ruby gem for ruby-based completion
* screen: basic config to have visible tabs
* git: just my gitignore
* other: .bash/completion/ contains ruby scripts with more completion goodies

Install
=======

Simply run `ruby install.rb` in this directory to symlink these files to
your home directory.
