# Description

These are dot files for apps I use every day.
Among these are:

* shell: shell-agnostic configuration under .sh/ and keybindings under .input\*
* zsh: aliases, functions, completions under .zsh/
* git: Handy git configs under .git\*
* clojure: Handy aliases for the clojure CLI under .clojure/
* tmux: Handy config under .tmux.conf
* lightning: My ruby gem for configurable cli completion under .lightning\*
* other: Other dotfiles are mostly for gems or clojars I've written that I may not use as actively

These dotfiles work on a macbook pro with an intel or M1 chip.

# Install

* Run `ruby install.rb` in this directory to symlink these files to
  your home directory and set up zsh.
* Optional: To use lightning or any of the other gem configs, install
  https://github.com/cldwalker/irbfiles#install.

# Additional Links

* For editor configs: see https://github.com/cldwalker/vimfiles,
  https://github.com/cldwalker/atomfiles and https://github.com/cldwalker/ltfiles.
* For configs to other applications just look for repositories ending in 'files' like
  https://github.com/cldwalker/irbfiles or https://github.com/cldwalker/hammerspoon-files.
