# Description

These are dot files for apps I use every day.
Among these are:

* shell: shell-agnostic configuration under .sh/ and keybindings under .input\*
* zsh: aliases, functions, completions under .zsh/
* git: Handy git configs under .git\*
* clojure: Handy aliases for the clojure CLI under .clojure/
* tmux: Handy config under .tmux.conf
* lightning: My ruby gem for configurable cli completion under .lightning\*
* other: Other dotfiles are mostly for gems or clojars I've written that I may not use as actively

# Install

Run `ruby install.rb` in this directory to symlink these files to
your home directory and set up zsh.

# Additional Links

* For configs to other applications just look for repositories ending in 'files' like
  https://github.com/cldwalker/irbfiles or https://github.com/cldwalker/hammerspoon-files.
